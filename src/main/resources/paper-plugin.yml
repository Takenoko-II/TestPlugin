    # Let's say that RegistryPlugin registers some data that your plugin needs to use
    # We don't need this during runtime, so it's not required in the server section.
    # However, can be added to both if needed
    # RegistryPlugin:
      # load: BEFORE
      # required: true
      # join-classpath: true # Defaults to true
  # server:
    # Add a required "RequiredPlugin" dependency, which will load AFTER your plugin.
    # RequiredPlugin:
      # load: AFTER
      # required: true
      # This means that your plugin will not have access to their classpath
      # join-classpath: false
